Health Risk of Prolonged Sitting: Prolonged sitting is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. It is important to break up long periods of sitting with movement.

Stretching Recommendation: After sitting for 30 minutes, perform simple stretches like neck rolls and shoulder shrugs to relieve tension. A gentle spinal twist can also help alleviate back stiffness.

Ergonomics Tip: Ensure your workspace is ergonomically sound. Your chair should support your lower back, and your monitor should be at eye level to prevent neck strain.
